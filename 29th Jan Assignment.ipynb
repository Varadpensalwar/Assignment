    "Ans- Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed line by line without the need for a compilation step. When you run a Python program, the source code is first translated into an intermediate form called bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter. This makes Python code very easy to write and test, but it can also be slower than compiled languages for some types of applications. However, Python does have tools like PyPy that use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up code execution."

Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation to indicate the grouping of statements.

The standard indentation level is four spaces, but some programmers prefer to use tabs or a different number of spaces.\n",
